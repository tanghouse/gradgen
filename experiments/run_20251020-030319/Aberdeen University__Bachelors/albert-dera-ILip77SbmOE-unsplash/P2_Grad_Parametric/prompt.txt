Identity-preserving edit. Keep the subject unchanged except wardrobe. Dress the subject in the official {UNIVERSITY} {DEGREE_LEVEL} graduation regalia: gown: {GOWN_DESC}; hood fabric: {HOOD_FABRIC}; hood colors: {HOOD_COLORS}; trim: {TRIM_DESC}; cap: {CAP_STYLE}; tassel: {TASSEL_COLOR}. Use the precise hood fold and color layout per university standards. Background: {BACKGROUND}. Lighting: {LIGHTING}. Half-body, eyes to camera, tidy posture. Ultra photo-real, true-to-color textiles.

Use the provided 'Design Board' image ONLY as a reference for gown/hood/cap style and colors; do not display the board itself. Preserve the person's identity and facial geometry. Photo-real textures and natural skin detail. Return ONE image only (finished portrait). --no text, watermarks, logos.
