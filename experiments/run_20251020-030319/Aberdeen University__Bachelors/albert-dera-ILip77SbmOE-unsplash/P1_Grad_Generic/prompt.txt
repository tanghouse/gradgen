Identity-preserving edit. Keep the subjectâ€™s face and skin texture. Dress them in a classic UK graduation set: matte black academic gown, square mortarboard cap with black tassel, and a simple black hood. Half-body framing. Neutral studio background gradient. Soft, flattering key light. Photo-realistic fabric folds; no distortion of facial features. --no text, watermarks, logos
